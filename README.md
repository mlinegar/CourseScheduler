# Introduction

This project will create a course scheduler for students at Reed College. It takes input from Reedâ€™s SOLAR API (which supplies a .JSON file), and uses this information to generate a database of courses, which students can use to create prospective schedules. 

# Setup

The modules used in this project can be downloaded using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It uses Django and several add-ons, and also requires PostgreSQL.
